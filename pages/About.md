- I've been a secretive person.
- I see people who can share things with their family, friends, therapists. I am able to too, most of them.
- This is a stream of consciousness writing, of all things I want to write about, but can't with my name attached to them, because people will
	- get hurt
	- won't understand
	- leave me
- I can't bear any of the above. The thought of it. Maybe they won't, but things will not remain the same.
- Now that the morose is out. This place will not necessarily only keep my secrets, it'll also be the journal that I always fear to write in (physically), too afraid it'll be read by somebody close.
- Here's to writing a lot — about me and what I am doing and why and what's happening with me — to finally be included in fiction – short stories, novellas, novels. Epic?
