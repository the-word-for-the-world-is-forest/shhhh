- I'm just sitting and there's no premeditation and I suddenly, intensely went back to the time and felt how it felt with M. The softness of her lips slipping on my mouth. The sharp uninhibited energy that floated us through the night, and many, for the next 6 months. I continued to keep messaging her, but I guess she might have changed her number. I just saw her Linkedin profile. I don't think there was before. And I saw that she was so close aroundâ€”in Mohali, in Dehradun. And now she's in Sweden, and I felt extremely sad that I could have met her. And now I might not ever.
